A brute force attack is a method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or networks by systematically attempting all possible combinations 
of passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys until the correct one is found. This type of attack relies on the sheer computational power to try numerous possibilities
rapidly, often using automated tools and scripts. Implementing strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and account lockout policies are essential measures to protect 
against brute force attacks.
